# The impact of political stability on FDIâ€”A panel analysis of ASEAN Economies

This project studied the impact of political stability on FDI inflows into ASEAN countries in the period after the 2008 financial crisis using panel data regression. To quantify political stability, we used the 'Political Stability and the Absence of Violence / Terrorism' metric from the World Governance Indicators database of the World Bank (Kaufmann & Kray, 2023). Macroeconomic variables were used to control for country heterogeneity. 

The data set *ASEAN_FDI_data.xlsx* contains the data on the governance indicators and economic variables that were used for the analysis. This R markdown file, *ASEAN_FDI.Rmd* contains the code used to run the regressions. It produces an html file as the output with the regression results as well as correlation matrices and diagnostic test results.
